Introduction
============

It's a pain trying to find a good copy of Vim that has all of the features I
need (Lua and Python support) and that's compiled regularly. So, I'm putting a
repository on Github that should make it easier for other people to compile Vim
for themselves on Windows. I list the dependencies below.

I automate the execution of ``vim_build.bat`` by creating a Windows Task. I synchronize the latest build with all of the Windows machines that I own using Syncthing.

Dependencies
===========

vim_build.bat uses git to grab the latest version of Vim. mingw32-make is used
to perform the compilation. This batch script has been tested on
mingw-w64 (i686-5.3.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v4-rev0).
  * Vim
  * Git
  * Mingw-w64
  * Add the above programs to your path

### Notes 
  * If you use credentials with your Github RSA key then I strongly recommend using the secure hypertext transfer protocol (``https://github.com``) to clone the Vim repository instead of using the secure shell protocol (``git@github.com``).
  * Make sure to select i686 and POSIX when configuring the installation of mingw-w64.
  * You can edit the environment variables in the batch file to point to the proper paths.
  * You can edit the environment variables in the ``Make_ming.mak`` file to point to the proper paths.

Room for Improvement
====================
  1. Right now there is no mechanism to check/handle errors nicely when compiling from the batch file. I would like a way to do this. Unsuccessful compilations can corrupt the repositories and require a clean. "Cleaning" entails deleting the repository from my hard drive and cloning Vim, again.
  1. I have not managed to compile a 64-bit version of Vim for Windows, yet. This is a big goal.
  1. This version of the batch file does not accept command line arguments. This would be something that I would like to implement in the future.
  1. Right now, only Python27 and Lua support has been successfully obtained with this batch file. Python33, Perl and Ruby are the next languages for which I would like to add support.
